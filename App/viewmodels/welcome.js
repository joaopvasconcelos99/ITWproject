Each Pokémon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant which makes it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings.<br/>Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”). During their adventures, Pokémon grow, level up and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon.';
